## Introduction

Most (if not all) quality software is thouroughly tested. Deep neural networks seem to have escaped this paradigm. 

Here, we attempt at solving the testing problem by proposing an extensive library to test deep neural networks beyond test-set performance. 



## Installation

```bash
pip install stimulus-py
```
